# VBA-challenge

Hey there, this repository contains a file with screenshots of the results, VB script, and the completed Excel file. 

In the file of the screenshots there are only 3. Each screenshot shows rows 1-27 and columns A-R. I only included screenshots of the tops of the results because there are over 753,000 worth of data - taking individual screenshots seems incorrect. Nowhere in the instructions or in the grading rubric does it specifically outline if we are supposed to take screenshots to match the screenshots we are shown/given, or if we are supposed to screenshot 753,000+ rows of data. I have included the final Excel file as well so one can view all results. 

The BAS script file should open in Visual Studio, and it contains all code written for this project. It can be imported into Excel and run. I tried saving as simply VB Script and the file would not open. It does open in the BAS script file type. 

Finally, I have included the completed Multi Year Stock Data file. This way if one can view all results easily.
