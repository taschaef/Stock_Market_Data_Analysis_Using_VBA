# VBA-challenge

Hey there, this repository contains a file with screenshots of the results, VB script, and the completed Excel file. 

In the file of the screenshots, I have only included screenshots of the Excel workbook. 

The BAS script file should open in Visual Studio, and it contains all code written for this project. It can be imported into Excel and run. I tried saving as simply VB Script and the file would not open. It does open in the BAS script file type. 

Finally, I have included the completed Multi Year Stock Data file. This way if one can view all results easily.
